# Swift Concurrency Migration - Testing Guide

## Overview
This migration successfully eliminates all `performAsync()` and `DispatchSemaphore` blocking patterns in favor of native Swift Concurrency with actor-based state management.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. CaptureSession Actor (`CaptureSession.swift`)
- **Purpose**: Centralizes device and writer state management
- **Lifecycle**: Enforces sequential operations: configure ‚Üí start ‚Üí record/toggle ‚Üí stop ‚Üí reset
- **Safety**: Actor isolation prevents race conditions
- **Cancellation**: Respects `Task.isCancelled` for graceful shutdown

### 2. Eliminated Blocking Patterns (`AppDelegate+Session.swift`)
- **Removed**: 43 lines of `performAsync` helper methods with `DispatchSemaphore`
- **Replaced**: 4 call sites with proper `async/await` patterns
- **Methods Updated**: `startSession()`, `stopSession()`, `startRecording()`, `stopRecording()`, `restartSession()`

### 3. Application Lifecycle (`AppDelegate.swift`)
- **Enhanced**: `applicationShouldTerminate` uses `.terminateLater` + `NSApp.reply()`
- **Added**: `cleanupAsync()` for graceful async shutdown
- **Improved**: All UI actions properly use `Task { @MainActor }`

### 4. AsyncStream Infrastructure (`AsyncExtensions.swift`)
- **StreamBridge**: Actor for high-frequency callback bridging
- **Buffering**: Configurable policies for backpressure handling
- **Termination**: Proper cleanup and cancellation support

## Manual Testing Instructions

### üöÄ Application Startup
```
1. Launch the application
2. Verify: No blocking or hangs during startup
3. Verify: Main window appears promptly
4. Verify: Device detection works properly
```

### üìπ Capture Session Lifecycle
```
1. Start capture session (should be automatic)
2. Verify: Preview appears without blocking
3. Verify: No console errors about threading
4. Stop and restart capture session
5. Verify: Clean transitions with proper sequencing
```

### üî¥ Recording Operations
```
1. Start recording
2. Verify: UI remains responsive
3. Verify: Recording button updates immediately
4. Verify: Dock icon shows "REC" badge
5. Stop recording
6. Verify: Clean stop with proper cleanup
7. Verify: No hanging processes
```

### ü™ü Window Management
```
1. Start recording
2. Attempt to close window while recording
3. Verify: Window closes gracefully after recording stops
4. Verify: No deadlocks or force-quit needed
```

### üö™ Application Termination
```
1. Start recording
2. Command+Q to quit application
3. Verify: Application shows "terminating later" behavior
4. Verify: Recording stops first, then app quits cleanly
5. Verify: NSApp.reply() is called properly
6. Verify: No force termination required
```

### üìú Scripting Interface
```
1. Test AppleScript commands for start/stop recording
2. Verify: Commands return promptly (don't block)
3. Verify: Recording state changes happen asynchronously
4. Verify: No timeout errors in script execution
```

## Expected Behavior Changes

### ‚úÖ Improvements
- **No blocking**: UI never freezes during capture operations
- **Responsive**: All buttons and controls respond immediately
- **Clean shutdown**: Graceful termination even during recording
- **Thread safety**: No race conditions in device state management

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Subtle Changes
- **Async timing**: Some operations that were instant are now properly async
- **Error handling**: Better error propagation through async chains
- **State consistency**: Actor ensures state changes are atomic

## Verification Checklist

```
‚ñ° Application starts without blocking
‚ñ° Capture session starts/stops cleanly  
‚ñ° Recording starts/stops without UI freezing
‚ñ° Window closes properly during operations
‚ñ° Application quits gracefully with .terminateLater
‚ñ° No deadlocks under any scenario
‚ñ° Scripting commands remain functional
‚ñ° No console warnings about main thread blocking
‚ñ° Memory usage remains stable
‚ñ° All existing functionality preserved
```

## Debugging Tips

### Common Issues to Watch For:
1. **Main thread violations**: Should be eliminated completely
2. **Deadlocks**: Look for hanging UI or unresponsive buttons
3. **Race conditions**: Check for inconsistent device states
4. **Memory leaks**: Verify proper cleanup in actor and streams

### Console Messages:
- Look for "NOTICE:" messages showing clean lifecycle transitions
- Watch for "ERROR:" messages indicating state violations
- No "Main thread checker" warnings should appear

## Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered, the old `performAsync` helper methods can be temporarily restored by reverting commits, but the new actor-based approach should be debugged and fixed instead for long-term maintainability.
