/// Actor that encapsulates CaptureManager functionality and provides async interface for video capture operations.
///
/// `CaptureSession` provides thread-safe access to video capture functionality through Swift's actor system.
/// It manages the lifecycle of capture sessions and recording operations while maintaining compatibility
/// with existing synchronous APIs through bridging functions.
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```swift
/// let captureSession = CaptureSession()
/// 
/// // Initialize and configure
/// let created = await captureSession.createManager()
/// await captureSession.applySessionParameters(...)
/// 
/// // Start capture session
/// let started = await captureSession.startCaptureSession()
/// 
/// // Begin recording
/// let recording = await captureSession.startRecording(to: movieURL)
/// ```
///
/// - Note: This actor maintains sequential processing behavior for compatibility with existing code.
/// - Important: All capture and recording operations are asynchronous and must be called with `await`.
